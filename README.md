Statistics is a fundamental component of data science, providing the techniques and methods for collecting, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data. In data science, statistics is used to gain insights from data, make data-driven decisions, and validate results. It involves descriptive statistics to summarize and visualize data, inferential statistics to draw conclusions and make predictions from data, and probability theory to understand the uncertainty and variability of data. Statistical techniques such as hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and machine learning algorithms rely on statistical principles to extract meaningful information from data.
